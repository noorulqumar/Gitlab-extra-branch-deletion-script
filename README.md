# Gitlab-extra-branch-deletion-script

this is bit advance script.
as we will pass a file with group and projects name( as shown in projects.txt file), and it will remove the extra branches from each project. 


From get a file with all the project list we can run the (get-all-groups-and-projects.sh file) it will create a file for us with all the projects and groups.
